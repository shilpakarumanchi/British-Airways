# Analysis of Customer Review data for British Airways
## Table of Contents
## Introduction
British Airways is a UK based airline that has been established in 1974. It is the second largest UK based carrier based on fleet size and passenger number. British Airways is the first passenger airline to have generated more than US$1 billion on a single air route in a year (from 1 April 2017, to 31 March 2018, on the New York-JFK â€“ London-Heathrow route). In 2020, due to the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, British Airways had to reduce its 42,000-strong workforce by 12,000 jobs. According to the estimate by IAG, a parent company, it will take the air travel industry several years to return to previous performance and profitability levels. However, 2022 saw a dramatic increase in travel, and the company now faced a worker shortage, forcing it to cancel more than 1,500 flights. I wonder if this shortage in airline workforce had impacted the customer satisfaction.
 
## Overview of Dataset 
I have obtained global customer review data for British Airways from 2016 to 2023.  Passengers have rated six different services provided by the airline. This includes Ground and Cabin staff, Entertainemnt, Food, Value for money and Seat Comfort. A score of 1-5 has been provided for each of these services. We also have information on the departure Country, Seat type, aircraft model along with many other information for each of the reviews.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Tableau
  
## Data Exploration & Cleaning
- Noticed '-1' values for many ratings. I replaced -1 ratings by the average rating within each service provided.
- I generated a new variable "Average Rating" that shows the average of all the 6 services provided by the airline.
- Explored number of reviews by Country
