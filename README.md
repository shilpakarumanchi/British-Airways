Here I cleaned the British Airways - Customer review data set in Python.
I replaced -1 ratings by 0.
The Overall rating providing in the file has some rating values of 10, where as there is only a maximum rating of 5 for all the sub-categories like Canbin staff service, Entertainment, Food and Beverages etc.
I generated a new variable "Average Rating" that shows the average pf all the 6 sub-categories.
